# GettingCleaningData
Explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected
- 'run_analysis.R' - the R script that: merges the multiple data sets into one data set, extracts the measurements for mean and standard deviation, uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set, labels the data set with descriptive variable names, and finally creates a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
- 'CodeBook.md' - describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data
